Repository for the CloudFever Hackathon by NovoNordisk 
The repo contains the React Frontend to display the optimal lab configuration assuming a gene as an input. 
The Machine Learning backend was implemented and hosted on AWS SageMaker.

Disclaimer: The Hackathon took part at the IT University of Copenhagen and was hosted by NovoNordisk. Since the Cloud Infrastructure, Machine Learning Setup and Frontend Dashboard were developed in 24h by a team of 5 please do not expect super clean code :)
